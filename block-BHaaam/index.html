                <p>It is very surprising, but this dog actually belongs on this list. At first glance, and if he is trained and treated well, he makes a great and lovable family pet. These dogs are, however, very emotional. Because of this, poorly trained dogs tend to attack. According to JAVMA’s study, the Cocker Spaniel has been responsible for over 59 fatal attacks over the last 25 years. In 2016, an elderly man in Jacksonville, Florida was attacked by a pack of stray dogs, and at least one of them was identified as a Cocker Spaniel. The man didn’t make it.</p>

            <h2>The Great Dane</h2>

            <article>
                <p>The Great Dane is an incredibly large dog. He actually holds the record for being the tallest dog in the world, standing at 44 inches. Originally, he was bred to hunt deer and wild boar. Over the years, being a hunter has become a genetic trait for this dog. If he is trained properly, the Great Dane can be an amazing family dog. These dogs typically love children, and many will allow small children to ride on their back like a horse.

                    If these dogs are not trained properly however, their massive size can make them very dangerous. If the dog becomes aggressive and he has his height and his weight of up to 120 pounds behind him, you could find yourself in a very scary situation. If these dogs get the love, attention, and training that they need, they will make a wonderful family pet. According to JAVMA’s study, between the years of 1978 and 1998, the Great Dane had a total of 7 fatalities.</p>
